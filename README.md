## About    
This is a project written for ENGL-351, [Language Technology](https://www.rit.edu/cla/english/351-language-technology), at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/).

## Goals
The overarching goal of this project is to learn how to develop a proper language model, and to use that language model to analyze a selection of text in order to estimate the time period in which that selection of text was written.

### Milestones
1. Gather the required linguistic data.
2. Create a language model from that data.
3. Streamline that language model.
4. Create a command line interface that allows the user to query the language model.
5. Generate a result based on the query, verify that the result is accurate, and return that result to the user.
6. Create a graphical user interface that allows the user to query the language model.

## External Libraries
This project makes use of the Stanford CoreNLP, a java library which includes a wide variety of functions related to natural language processing. See [Stanford CoreNLP](http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml) for more information.

The linguistic data used in this project was gathered from many literary works provided and maintained by [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).
