## About    
This is a project written for ENGL-351, [Language Technology](https://www.rit.edu/cla/english/351-language-technology), at the [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/).

5. Type the name of the input text file with the file extension.
6. Press ENTER.
7. An estimated publication year will be displayed.


## Goals
The overarching goal of this project is to learn how to develop a proper language model, and to use that language model to analyze a selection of text in order to estimate the time period in which that selection of text was written.

### Milestones
1. Gather the required linguistic data.
2. Create a language model from that data.
3. Streamline that language model.
4. Create a command line interface that allows the user to query the language model.
5. Generate a result based on the query, verify that the result is accurate, and return that result to the user.
6. Create a graphical user interface that allows the user to query the language model.

## External Libraries
This project makes use of NLTK, a platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. See [NLTK 3.0](http://www.nltk.org/) for more information.

The linguistic data used in this project was gathered from many literary works provided and maintained by [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).
